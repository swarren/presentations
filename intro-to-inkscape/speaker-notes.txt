Basic Inkscape
================================================================================

Free (OSS).
Linux, Windows, Mac
Download from inkscape.org
Vector graphics not bitmap (scalable)
SVG is native data format, can import/export many formats
For nerds: Write plugins in Python, or generate SVG data from Python!
Lots of good tutorials on youtube.com

UI:
- Menu
- Toolbars:
  - top: dynamic options
  - left: mouse actions
  - bottom: color palette
  - right: all kinds of knobs to twiddle

Open a file, scroll and zoom
  /home/swarren/svn_wa/files/sca/personal-device/stephen-device-registered-redrawn.svg
  Mouse scroll or wheel actions
  Scrollbars  
  Ctrl + cursor keys

Draw a line
  Toolbar on left, or keyboard shortcut (Shift-F6)
  Click to start, double-click to end
  Ctrl: Snap to common angles
  Multiple clicks: multiple lines
  Can join back to start point to make a polygon

Draw a square or circle
  Same as a line, just different shapes
  Square/rect: F4
  Circle/ellipse: F5

Fill and stroke
  Get dialog:
    Right-click object, select Fill and Stroke
    Object menu, Fill and Stroke.
    Ctrl-Shift-F.
  Fill color
  Stroke color, width, style
  Selecting colors from palette toolbar
    click: fill
    shift-click: stroke

Alpha blended fill
  Helps you see overlapped objects

Arrow in toolbar, or F1 to change to select mode, or Escape
  Click to select
    Use Alt-click to cycle through objects on top of each-other; good for complex drawings
    Or, drag top object away, click the object you want, undo the move (Ctrl-Z)
  Drag strokes/fills to move
    Ctrl-drag move h/v only
  Drag handles to resize
    Ctrl-drag maintains aspect ratio
    Shift-drag maintains center
  Click again to cycle between move/rotate mode
    Drag handles to rotate or shear

Exact size/position
  Type numbers into toolbar too
  resize: toolbar button to maintain aspect ratio if needed

Copy, paste, cut, duplicate
  Ctrl-C, V, X, D
  Even between documents!
  Drag to select (multiple objects)

Z-order
  Set different fill colors for demo
  Home, End, Page-up, Page-down

Object vs Path
  Square/rect/circle/ellipse/text are objects; always this shape
  Object -> Path converts to path; a series of connected lines

Edit paths by node (F2)
  Click to select object
  Drag individual points
  Drag *paths* to get bezier curve
    Handles appear from nodes that can be moved to affect curve
  Nodes can be sharp, smooth, etc.
  Add/remove nodes
    Toolbar at top for many actions
    Select node, delete key
    Double-click to add node

Undo/redo
  Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-Shift-Z
  Or menus

Object toolbar:
  Set object X/Y/W/H to specific numbers
  Keep aspect ratio toggle
  Scale stroke size toggle and more

Transform dialog box
  Object -> Transform
  Scale, rotate
  Scale: Toolbar buttons to scale stroke too, or not!

Align/distribute toolbox
  Object -> Align and Distribute
  Relative to page, selection area, first/last selected

Grouping
  Ctrl-G/Ctrl-Shift-G
  Apply actions to many objects at once
  Easier to manage separate parts of a complex drawing

File export
  PDF, PNG, DXF, ...

Snapping
  Enable/disable/control via toolbar on right
  Points when starting/ending lines
  Points or edges when moving objects
  Very useful for complex drawings or repetitive layouts (grids)

Inkscape for lucet fork design
================================================================================

Example: https://github.com/swarren/sca-making/blob/master/lucet-forks/lucet-fork.svg

Measure all the interesting points on the existing fork.

Draw rect for overall outline. Set w/h based on measurements.
1.875 x 6.225

Duplicate rect and set w based on measurements.
Do this for each interesting width.
1.25 x 6.225
0.875 x 6.225
0.625 x 6.225

Draw a single vertical line for the center position.
Select all, align horizontal centers.

Duplicate overall rect, and set h based on measurements.
Ensure the rect is moved to align with bottom of overall rect
Do this for each interesting height.
1.875 x 5
1.875 x 3.375
1.875 x 2.5
1.875 x 1.875
1.875 x 0.875

Draw polygon linking all the interesting points with straight lines.
Probably want to set polygon stroke to contrasting color.
NOTE: Only draw the left half of the shape; we will dup/union later
  to get symmetry.
F2 (node editor), then drag the lines to the right curve shape.

Draw circle for hole and place it.

Dup the polygon and circle, move outside grid.
Dup the polygon, flip horiz, snap it to R side.
Union the 2 polygons.
Maybe combine polygon and circle.

Some LASER cutter SW imports the SVG directly.
Other SW might need a DXF etc.

Inkscape for Heraldry

>>>>> Reproducing the Outlands War Ensign:

War Ensign: Bitmap tracing:

Original bitmap: https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/other/outlands-war-ensign.original.gif
Edited: https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/other/outlands-war-ensign.original.attire-only.png
File/Import or Ctrl-I to import bitmap to Inkscape
Path/Trace Bitmap or Shift-Alt-B to trace the bitmap; convert to vector format
Enable live preview
Various scan types; experiment for best results
Brightness cutoff works well for this image
Manually clean up (move, add, delete) nodes after conversion
  Open outlands-war-ensign.redrawn.svg to show the extra overlaid black lines

War Ensign: Background:

Draw 3" square, green fill, 0.5mm black path
Horizontal dividers:
  Draw 5 vertical lines taller than the square
  Either snap L and R lines to square, or use align/distribute on them
  Select all 4 lines, and distribute them all horizontally
Repeat last 3 steps for horizontal dividers too
  Can use duplicate, rotate 90, snap

Use "Draw Bezier curves and lines" (Shift-F6) for each yellow triangle
  Use snapping to place points
  Create points in a clockwise direction

To create final image:
  Duplicate background and tines
  Move to a clear part of the document and compose them

Tip:
Working with a copy keeps a record of the steps you took;
  you can easily go back and tweak an earlier step without starting from scratch

Hide the work by:
  Select the final image
  File/Document Properties or Ctrl-Shift-D
  Resize page to drawing or selection
  Work is now outside visible area to any default SVG viewer, or file export

>>>>> Reproducing the Caerthe Populace Badge:

Bitmap tracing (grays) to extract leaf shape

Concentric circles to make the bordure and inner edge of embattlement
  Manually set radius, aligned center
  Can use different colors, or partially transparent layers (fill -> opacity) to see through
  Path difference to get the bordure ring, out to inner edge of embattlement

Rays for embattlement:
  Draw circle
  One line drawn manually, then duplicated/rotated to get the wedges
  Align line on circle vertically & horizontally
  Draw vertically with Ctrl held
  Ctrl-D to duplicate
  Transform (Object/Transform or Ctrl-Shift-M) -> Rotate -> 22.5 degrees -> apply
  Ctrl-D/apply multiple times to repeat
  Select all, rotate 11.25 degrees to orient correctly
  Set line widths very fine
  Fill (Shift-F7) alternating wedges

Limited size rays for embattlement:
  Duplicate all the rays
  Combine rays into a single shape (select all, Path/Union or Ctrl-Shift-+)
  Duplicate mid-size circle, align centers with ^^, Path/Intersect or Ctrl-Shift-*
  Z-order matters! Start with bottom shape and subtract the top.

Embattlement:
  Duplicate bordure ring from above
  Duplicate rays
  Align them V/H
  Subtract paths (Path/Subtract, or Ctrl--)

Background:
  Duplicate main circle
  Fill yellow
  Place behind embattlement

Leaves:
  Intersect leaves with a circle to cut them out of embattlement
  Set color green
  ((Optional: Path effects -> Pattern along path -> paste the tiny line w/ repeated copies type))
  Path/object to path on the leaf.
  Intersect objects to extract just one leaf
  Draw white fill, no stroke lines or rectangles for the veins
  Set blur ~2% to get smooth vein appearance
  Group the leaf and veins
  Duplicate and rotate 120 degrees to get 3 leaves, group together
  Scale and place result over background

>>>>> Reproducing the Caer Galen Populace Badge:

Path/Cut on a circle to do counter-change
Path/Intersect on harp to do counter-change
Put all the objects (e.g. duplicated harp) in place before this, so they stay aligned

>>>>> Reproducing the Nahrun Populace Badge:

Import pre-drawn cross crossly!

Object intersection for the bend
  Draw horizontally for ease of alignment when drawing, then rotate

Duplicate cross 5 times, then distribute within selection for the objects on the bend

Edit/Clone/Create Tiled Clones for all the crosses

>>>>> Reproducing the Plattefordham Populace Badge:

Duplicate and snap to create the grid of bricks

Intersection for the flaunches; ellipse and main badge outline

Draw one arrow manually, duplicate and rotate to get 3
Manually draw the bow parts
Intersect/union to get the center of the bow
Manually set Z order so the right objects shown on top

>>>>> Reproducing the Windkeep Populace Badge

Bitmap worked very well for the griffin

Distributed grid for the embattlement, followed by manual line drawing with snap-to-grid

>>>>> Reproducing the Unser Hafen Populace Badge

Write a program in Python to draw the design for me.
SVG generation libraries exist.
SVG is just a plain text format when it comes down to it. Edit it yourself!
https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/populace-badges/unser-hafen-populace-badge.py

Easy automated experimentation with tweaks to the design.
See the "n-up"/contact-sheet:

FIXME:

Aarquelle: Waves: Draw vertical link lines, select 2 wave lines + 2 straight lines, combine, then must join each of the 4 pairs of nodes to make it a single object.
