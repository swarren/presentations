Basic Inkscape
================================================================================

Free (OSS).
Linux, Windows, Mac
Download from inkscape.org
Vector graphics not bitmap
  (scalable; demo xmag for bitmaps, inkscape zooming for vector)
SVG is native data format, can import/export many formats
  Many other apps handle SVG, e.g. LightBurn (FCCH LASERs), VCarve Pro (FCCH CNC)
For nerds: Write plugins in Python, or generate SVG data from Python!
Lots of good tutorials on youtube.com (I watch a lot of "Logos by Nick")

Run `screenkey` to show keystrokes

UI:
- Menu
- Toolbars:
  - top: dynamic options
  - left: mouse actions
  - bottom: color palette
  - right: all kinds of knobs to twiddle

Open a file, scroll and zoom
  /home/swarren/git_wa/files/sca/personal-device/stephen-device-registered-redrawn.svg
  Mouse scroll or wheel actions
  Ctrl + cursor keys

Draw a line
  Toolbar on left, or keyboard shortcut B (Bezier) or Shift-F6
  Click to start, click each point, double-click to end
    Multiple clicks: multiple lines
    Can join back to start point to make a polygon
  While drawing a line:
    Ctrl: Snap to common angles
  While clicking:
    Drag to make a curve rather than a straight line
  Cancel tool: s or Escape or F1
    Goes back to select/move/resize tool

Draw a square or circle
  Roughly the same as a line, just different shapes
  Shortcuts:
    Square/rect: r (Rectangle) or F4
    Circle/ellipse: e (Ellipse) or F5
  While dragging:
    Shift: First click is center rather than corner.
    Ctrl: Snap angle (aspect ration)

Fill and stroke
  Get dialog:
    Right-click object, select Fill and Stroke
    Object menu, Fill and Stroke.
    Ctrl-Shift-F.
  Fill color, Stroke color, Stroke style (width, and much more)
    Watch out: In older versions of Inkscape: The stroke width is included in object size!
    "Hairline" width is zero-width, but visible; useful for CAD.
  Selecting colors from palette toolbar
    click: fill
    shift-click: stroke

Select and Transform Objects tool (move, resize, rotate, deform)
  s or Escape or F1
  Click to select
  Drag strokes/fills to move
    Ctrl-drag move h/v only
  Drag handles to resize
    Ctrl-drag maintains aspect ratio
    Shift-drag maintains center
  Click again to cycle between move/rotate mode
    Drag corners to rotate
    Drag handles to rotate or shear
    Ctrl snaps angles

Object toolbar:
  Select object(s) then:
  Set object X/Y/W/H to specific numbers
  Keep aspect ratio toggle
  Scale stroke size toggle and more

Advanced selection
  Use Alt-click to cycle through objects on top of each-other; good for complex drawings
  Or, drag top object away, click the object you want, undo the move (Ctrl-Z)
  Drag to select (multiple objects)
  Shift-click objects to add to selection
  Ctrl-click objects to remove from selection
  Alt-drag and draw a line that intersects objectes to add to selection

Copy, paste, cut, duplicate
  Ctrl-C, V, X; copy, paste, cut
  Even between documents!
  Ctrl-D; duplicate

Z-order
  Set different fill colors for demo
  Home, End, Page-up, Page-down

Undo/redo
  Ctrl-Z/Ctrl-Shift-Z
  Or menus

Grouping
  Ctrl-G/Ctrl-Shift-G
  Apply actions to many objects at once
  Easier to manage separate parts of a complex drawing

Snapping
  Enable/disable/control via toolbar on top-right
  Points when starting/ending lines
  Points or edges when moving objects
  Very useful for complex drawings or repetitive layouts (grids)
  Highly configurable re: which points snap, and what they snap to

Import/Export
================================================================================

File menu > export
  Saves a copy of the document in various other formats
  PNG, JPG, PDF, SVG, ...

File menu > save as
  Also saves a copy of the document in various other formats
  Many more formats: DXF, EMF, EPS, HPGL, ...

File menu > import
  Loads another image file, and adds it to the current document
  The imported image/objects can be manipulate much like any other

Manipulating Objects
================================================================================

Object vs Path
  Square/rect/circle/ellipse/text are objects; always this shape
    Defined by a specific set of parameters/points
  Lines/Bezier are just a list of points and lines connecting them
  Object -> Path converts an object to a path
  Some operations or other SVG-handling-tools only deal with paths, not objects
    Especially for text!

Edit paths by node (F2)
  Click to select object
  Drag individual points
  Drag *paths* to get bezier curves
    Handles appear from nodes that can be moved to affect curve
  Nodes can be sharp, smooth, etc.
  Add/remove/join/break nodes
    Toolbar at top for many actions
    Select node, delete key
    Double-click to add node

Transform dialog box
  Object -> Transform
  Scale, rotate
  Scale: Toolbar buttons to scale stroke too, or not!

Align/distribute toolbox
  Object -> Align and Distribute
  Relative to page, selection area, first/last selected

Boolean Operations, Combining Paths
================================================================================

Boolean operations
  Select two objects
  Path > Union/Difference/Intersect/Exclude/Divide/...

Inset/Outset
  Select an object
  Path > Inset/Outset or Ctrl-(, Ctrl-)

Combine & Break Apart
  Draw some object
  Some fill, thick stroke
  Path > Stroke to path
  Now multiple objects (grouped):
    1 for the stroke, with 2 sub paths; 1 per side of the stroke
    1 for the fill, with 1 sub path; the original shape outline
  Delete fill
    Ctrl-Shift-K break apart - now 2 objects each with 1 path
    Ctrl-K       combine     - now 1 object with 2 paths
  Very powerful e.g for getting similar shapes slightly offset

Tips & Tricks
================================================================================

Opacity
  On Fill and Stroke tab
  e.g. 25% - 50%
  Helps you see through overlapped objects
  Or View > Display Mode > Outline / Outline Overlay

Align/distribute for sub-dividing
  Draw rectangle
  Line on left edge
  Duplicate move horizontally to middle (Ctrl-drag)
  Duplicate move all the way to the right (snap to corner)
  Select all 3 lines
  Alignment > Distribute horizontally with even horizontal gaps 
  Can divide in half, into 3, into n
  Can repeat vertically
  Can even work with angled lines...

Once you have a grid, can use the Bezier tool with snapping enabled to connect
nodes ("join the dots") and create quite complex shapes.

Working steps outside the document margins, multiple copies of the drawing
  caerthe-populace-badge.redrawn.svg is a good example

FIXME: bitmap tracing?

SCA-specific sections follow
================================================================================

TODO rework the rest of this doc?

Inkscape for lucet fork design
================================================================================

Example: https://github.com/swarren/sca-making/blob/master/lucet-forks-naalbinding-needles/lucet-fork.svg

Measure all the interesting points on the existing fork.

Draw rect for overall outline. Set w/h based on measurements.
1.875 x 6.225

Duplicate rect and set w based on measurements.
Do this for each interesting width.
1.25 x 6.225
0.875 x 6.225
0.625 x 6.225

Draw a single vertical line for the center position.
Select all, align horizontal centers.

Duplicate overall rect, and set h based on measurements.
Ensure the rect is moved to align with bottom of overall rect
Do this for each interesting height.
1.875 x 5
1.875 x 3.375
1.875 x 2.5
1.875 x 1.875
1.875 x 0.875

Draw polygon linking all the interesting points with straight lines.
Probably want to set polygon stroke to contrasting color.
NOTE: Only draw the left half of the shape; we will dup/union later
  to get symmetry.
F2 (node editor), then drag the lines to the right curve shape.

Draw circle for hole and place it.

Dup the polygon and circle, move outside grid.
Dup the polygon, flip horiz, snap it to R side.
Union the 2 polygons.
Maybe combine polygon and circle.

Some LASER cutter SW imports the SVG directly.
Other SW might need a DXF etc.

Inkscape for Heraldry

>>>>> Reproducing the Outlands War Ensign:

War Ensign: Bitmap tracing:

Original bitmap: https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/other/outlands-war-ensign.original.gif
Edited: https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/other/outlands-war-ensign.original.attire-only.png
File/Import or Ctrl-I to import bitmap to Inkscape
Path/Trace Bitmap or Shift-Alt-B to trace the bitmap; convert to vector format
Enable live preview
Various scan types; experiment for best results
Brightness cutoff works well for this image
Manually clean up (move, add, delete) nodes after conversion
  Open outlands-war-ensign.redrawn.svg to show the extra overlaid black lines

War Ensign: Background:

Draw 3" square, green fill, 0.5mm black path
Horizontal dividers:
  Draw 5 vertical lines taller than the square
  Either snap L and R lines to square, or use align/distribute on them
  Select all 4 lines, and distribute them all horizontally
Repeat last 3 steps for horizontal dividers too
  Can use duplicate, rotate 90, snap

Use "Draw Bezier curves and lines" (Shift-F6) for each yellow triangle
  Use snapping to place points
  Create points in a clockwise direction

To create final image:
  Duplicate background and tines
  Move to a clear part of the document and compose them

Tip:
Working with a copy keeps a record of the steps you took;
  you can easily go back and tweak an earlier step without starting from scratch

Hide the work by:
  Select the final image
  File/Document Properties or Ctrl-Shift-D
  Resize page to drawing or selection
  Work is now outside visible area to any default SVG viewer, or file export

>>>>> Reproducing the Caerthe Populace Badge:

Bitmap tracing (grays) to extract leaf shape

Concentric circles to make the bordure and inner edge of embattlement
  Manually set radius, aligned center
  Can use different colors, or partially transparent layers (fill -> opacity) to see through
  Path difference to get the bordure ring, out to inner edge of embattlement

Rays for embattlement:
  Draw circle
  One line drawn manually, then duplicated/rotated to get the wedges
  Align line on circle vertically & horizontally
  Draw vertically with Ctrl held
  Ctrl-D to duplicate
  Transform (Object/Transform or Ctrl-Shift-M) -> Rotate -> 22.5 degrees -> apply
  Ctrl-D/apply multiple times to repeat
  Select all, rotate 11.25 degrees to orient correctly
  Set line widths very fine
  Fill (Shift-F7) alternating wedges

Limited size rays for embattlement:
  Duplicate all the rays
  Combine rays into a single shape (select all, Path/Union or Ctrl-Shift-+)
  Duplicate mid-size circle, align centers with ^^, Path/Intersect or Ctrl-Shift-*
  Z-order matters! Start with bottom shape and subtract the top.

Embattlement:
  Duplicate bordure ring from above
  Duplicate rays
  Align them V/H
  Subtract paths (Path/Subtract, or Ctrl--)

Background:
  Duplicate main circle
  Fill yellow
  Place behind embattlement

Leaves:
  Intersect leaves with a circle to cut them out of embattlement
  Set color green
  ((Optional: Path effects -> Pattern along path -> paste the tiny line w/ repeated copies type))
  Path/object to path on the leaf.
  Intersect objects to extract just one leaf
  Draw white fill, no stroke lines or rectangles for the veins
  Set blur ~2% to get smooth vein appearance
  Group the leaf and veins
  Duplicate and rotate 120 degrees to get 3 leaves, group together
  Scale and place result over background

>>>>> Reproducing the Caer Galen Populace Badge:

Path/Cut on a circle to do counter-change
Path/Intersect on harp to do counter-change
Put all the objects (e.g. duplicated harp) in place before this, so they stay aligned

>>>>> Reproducing the Nahrun Populace Badge:

Import pre-drawn cross crossly!

Object intersection for the bend
  Draw horizontally for ease of alignment when drawing, then rotate

Duplicate cross 5 times, then distribute within selection for the objects on the bend

Edit/Clone/Create Tiled Clones for all the crosses

>>>>> Reproducing the Plattefordham Populace Badge:

Duplicate and snap to create the grid of bricks

Intersection for the flaunches; ellipse and main badge outline

Draw one arrow manually, duplicate and rotate to get 3
Manually draw the bow parts
Intersect/union to get the center of the bow
Manually set Z order so the right objects shown on top

>>>>> Reproducing the Windkeep Populace Badge

Bitmap worked very well for the griffin

Distributed grid for the embattlement, followed by manual line drawing with snap-to-grid

>>>>> Reproducing the Unser Hafen Populace Badge

Write a program in Python to draw the design for me.
SVG generation libraries exist.
SVG is just a plain text format when it comes down to it. Edit it yourself!
https://github.com/swarren/sca-devices-badges/blob/master/outlands/populace-badges/unser-hafen-populace-badge.py

Easy automated experimentation with tweaks to the design.
See the "n-up"/contact-sheet:

FIXME:

Aarquelle: Waves: Draw vertical link lines, select 2 wave lines + 2 straight lines, combine, then must join each of the 4 pairs of nodes to make it a single object.
